User> The following is the story of a character named Callum:   Callum Stoneshield is a mountain dwarf, aged 199, approaching the end of his middle years and relearning what it means to be an adventurer and to face danger for the sake of other people. Callum has lived a slow, calm life, only punctuated by couple decades or so of low stakes adventuring in his youth, and the glowing, boundless joy of his marriage to the halfling man named Coremin Dandelion. After spending adulthood settled in a small town in Estagund, working with exquisite slowness and care on his craft, Callum lived through Coremin’s twilight years and put him in the ground when he died of old age. Now widowed, grieving but happy to have spent 100 years with his beloved, he realized the speed of commerce and the world around him was too fast without his husband. It would have been difficult to keep his house, and his dedication to true craftsmanship at the same time. A few years of trying to keep living in the small, commercial town without Coremin brought Callum to a crossroads. He could try and teach his old brain new tricks and fumble through the commercial world, he could make the long, long trek back to his dwarven homeland and hope to find a place to retire with what he had saved of his work, or he could set out into the world and finally see a bit more of it and live with a bit more risk. He chose the last one, lifting his rusted, outdated rapier off of its place on the wall, selling his home, and marching off into the world. Planning a meandering trek from East to West, and attracted by stories of ruins so old they seemed to have a will of their own, Callum booked passage to Raurin the Dust Desert. It was only when he arrived that he realized he couldn’t easily leave, but he’s making the best of it.    Help me generate ideas for Callum's homeland.
