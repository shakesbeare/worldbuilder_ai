Agent> In the enchanted woods, the corruption caused by Evil Adria's influence has transformed the once magical inhabitants into hostile creatures. Here are some of the creatures that players may encounter in their first adventure at 2nd level:

1) Corrupted Sprites: These mischievous and playful fey creatures have been twisted by the dark magic. Once guardians of the forest, they now attack intruders with their sharp claws and venomous bites.

2) Shadow Wolves: Once majestic and loyal companions to the forest's inhabitants, these wolves have been tainted by Evil Adria's darkness. They now prowl the woods, their eyes glowing with malevolent energy, and attack any who dare to venture too close.

3) Blight Treants: These ancient tree-like creatures were once protectors of the enchanted woods. However, their branches have withered, and their once vibrant foliage has turned a sickly shade of black. They attack intruders with their gnarled branches and unleash powerful curses.

4) Corrupted Dryads: Once graceful and ethereal guardians of the forest, these dryads have become corrupted by Evil Adria's influence. Their once beautiful forms are now twisted and grotesque, and they use their magic to ensnare and drain the life force of unsuspecting travelers.

5) Darkling Pixies: These mischievous fey creatures were once known for their playful pranks. However, their once colorful wings have turned black, and their pranks have become dangerous and deadly. They attack with tiny razor-sharp daggers and use their dark magic to confuse and disorient their foes.

Encountering these corrupted creatures will provide players with their first taste of the dangers that lie within the enchanted woods. As they battle through these twisted foes, they will also uncover clues and unravel the mystery behind the forest's corruption, setting them on their path to restoring balance and defeating Evil Adria.
